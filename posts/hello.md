Hi there.

It's been a while since I've had a proper home on the web. To say that I've neglected this home is something of an understatement &ndash; the service that hosted my old blog shut down, and several years passed before I realized anything had happened.

With any luck, this site will become a sporadically-updated collection of musings, links, recommendations, and esoterica. I intend to focus on "recommendations" over "reviews," as I have little interest in being a critic, as [others](https://pitchfork.com) seem to have covered that ground in tedious and excruciating detail. Similarly, I'm opting to self-publish, as I have very little desire to [produce free content](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy) for the benefit of large corporations run by [horrible people](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jack-dorsey-twitter-interview_n_5c3e2601e4b01c93e00e2a00). As I've found my social media output dwindling due to my dissatisfaction with these platforms, I've felt an increasing need to an alternative outlet for online expression. Maybe this will be it.

I have few delusions that I will achieve any level of popularity or notoriety here. My previous attempt to establish a public internet presence produced little of interest, apart from, ironically, an [extremely popular](https://www.flickr.com/photos/schmod/419640051/in/photolist-D5Lni) photograph of a blank sheet of paper. I'm okay with this &ndash; being internet-famous sounds awful.

On the other hand, if you _do_ want to follow me, you'll be able to do so at your own convenience. There are no logins, no ads, and an [RSS Feed](/feed/feed.xml) is available.

Anyway. We'll see where this goes.
